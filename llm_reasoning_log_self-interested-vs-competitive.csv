Round,Player,Strategy,Decision,Reasoning
1,0,self-interested,defect,"there is no history with the opponent, and defecting maximizes my immediate benefit by ensuring i receive 0 years if the opponent cooperates. it"s a safer strategy to start with, as it guarantees i avoid the worst-case scenario initially."
2,0,self-interested,defect,"both of us have been defecting, resulting in a stable outcome of 3 years each. defecting minimizes my risk of receiving 5 years if i cooperate and the opponent defects."
3,0,self-interested,defect,"i prioritize minimizing my sentence. defecting ensures i avoid the worst-case scenario of 5 years if the opponent defects. the opponent alternated their moves; their last move was cooperation, but i cannot be sure they will continue. defecting reduces risk of exploitation."
4,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting has minimized my sentence in previous rounds and my opponent has defected twice in the last three rounds. since my goal is to minimize my own prison sentence, continuing to defect is the best strategy to avoid a higher penalty if the opponent decides to defect again."
5,0,self-interested,defect,"the opponent has cooperated inconsistently, while i have been defecting. defecting ensures i don"t receive the worst outcome of 5 years if they defect. the opponent"s cooperation doesn"t indicate a reliable pattern to exploit for mutual cooperation, so defecting minimizes risk."
6,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting has consistently minimized my sentence while the opponent"s strategy is unpredictable. continuing to defect ensures i avoid the worst outcome of 5 years."
7,0,self-interested,defect,"given my recent history of defecting and the opponent"s mixed strategy, defecting ensures i don"t risk receiving 5 years if they defect. with 12 years to my 22, maintaining a lower score remains my priority."
8,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting consistently has minimized my prison time compared to cooperating, as seen from the payoff matrix. my opponent is more likely to defect, given their recent moves and current higher score, making cooperation risky for increasing my sentence. defecting remains the best strategy to potentially maintain or reduce my sentence."
9,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting has consistently minimized my prison sentence in previous rounds. the opponent has cooperated in the past but is now defecting, likely reacting to my strategy. continuing to defect protects against the possibility of them defecting again, which minimizes my risk of a higher sentence."
10,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting consistently has minimized my sentence compared to cooperating, especially when the opponent also defects. the opponent"s recent cooperation could be an attempt to change strategy, but given my self-interested goal, defecting remains the optimal choice to avoid potential extra years if they defect again."
11,0,self-interested,defect,"given the opponent"s recent pattern of mostly defecting, continuing to defect minimizes my risk of receiving 5 years if they defect. defecting ensures either 0 or 3 years, which is better than risking 5 years by cooperating when the opponent is likely to defect again. my goal is to minimize my own sentence."
12,0,self-interested,defect,"given the opponent"s recent tendency to defect and my self-interested strategy, defecting minimizes potential risk. cooperation could lead to a high penalty if the opponent defects."
13,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting has consistently minimized my sentence in recent rounds. the opponent"s occasional cooperation suggests they may be trying to test my strategy, but defecting ensures i avoid the 5-year penalty risk of cooperating while maintaining a competitive edge."
14,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting minimizes my prison sentence in the short term if the opponent continues to cooperate. with a history of mutual defections, the opponent is likely to defect, making cooperation risky and likely to result in a longer sentence for me."
15,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, establishing a pattern of mutual defection. continuing to defect minimizes my sentence compared to cooperating, given the opponent"s likely response."
16,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, suggesting a mutual understanding of minimizing immediate loss. since cooperation hasn"t been established and the opponent is likely to continue defecting, defecting remains the optimal strategy to avoid being exploited and receiving a 5-year sentence."
17,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating that mutual defection is the established pattern. continuing to defect minimizes my prison time in the short term, as cooperating while the opponent defects would lead to a worse outcome for me. changing strategy without indication of opponent"s cooperation would be risky."
18,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting for the past five rounds, indicating a mutual expectation of defection. continuing to defect minimizes my prison time under the current pattern, as a sudden switch to cooperation without reciprocation would increase my sentence significantly."
19,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been defecting consistently, indicating a mutual lack of trust. defecting ensures i avoid the worst-case scenario of 5 years if the opponent defects again. continuing to defect maintains the stable equilibrium of 3 years each, minimizing potential risk for me."
20,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, and shifting to cooperation unilaterally would result in a higher sentence for me. maintaining defection minimizes my risk of receiving a higher penalty given the current opponent"s pattern."
21,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, indicating a lack of trust and cooperation. continuing to defect ensures i avoid the worst-case scenario of cooperating while the opponent defects, which would result in a higher personal cost."

23,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable pattern where each receives 3 years per round. defecting minimizes my risk of receiving a higher sentence of 5 years if the opponent continues to defect, which is likely given the history."
24,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, indicating a lack of trust or willingness to cooperate. continuing to defect ensures i avoid the worst outcome of receiving 5 years if i cooperate and the opponent defects. defecting results in a predictable outcome of 3 years, which is better than the potential 5 years if i take the risk to cooperate."
25,0,self-interested,defect,"both i and my opponent have been consistently defecting. changing my strategy to cooperate could lead to a worse outcome for me if my opponent continues to defect. defecting ensures i don"t receive the maximum penalty of 5 years."
26,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting. continuing to defect minimizes my prison time in the short term, as cooperating would result in a higher penalty if the opponent continues to defect. the opponent has shown no indication of shifting strategy, so defecting remains rational."
27,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, suggesting a mutual strategy of defection. given my self-interest and the current trend, defecting minimizes my risk of receiving the higher penalty if my opponent defects again."
28,0,self-interested,defect,"my recent strategy has been to defect, which minimizes my sentence if the opponent defects. despite the opponent"s recent cooperation, there is no guarantee they won"t defect again. consistently defecting ensures i avoid the 5-year penalty from cooperating when they defect."
29,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting minimizes my sentence when the opponent is likely to defect, which is consistent with their recent behavior. maintaining a defect strategy is rational to avoid high risks of cooperation."
30,0,self-interested,defect,"given my self-interested strategy and recent patterns, both players mostly defect. defecting minimizes risk of 5 years if opponent defects, and offers 0 years if they cooperate."
31,0,self-interested,defect,"given the opponent"s recent tendency to defect and my goal to minimize my own sentence, defecting is the safer choice to avoid potentially receiving 5 years if they defect."
32,0,self-interested,defect,"given my self-interested strategy and the recent pattern of mutual defection, continuing to defect minimizes potential long-term risk by avoiding the 5-year penalty associated with cooperating when the opponent defects. my goal is to minimize my own sentence, and defecting is safer given the opponent"s recent behavior."
33,0,self-interested,defect,"given the current pattern of mutual defection, switching to cooperation would result in a higher penalty if the opponent continues to defect. maintaining my strategy of defection minimizes my sentence risk. current scores indicate that both players are entrenched in a defection strategy, and deviating unilaterally would be disadvantageous."
34,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating a mutual lack of trust and cooperation. continuing to defect minimizes my prison sentence risk, as cooperating could lead to a higher penalty if the opponent defects again. defecting maintains my current advantage."
35,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently chosen to defect in recent rounds, indicating a mutual lack of trust or cooperation. defecting minimizes my sentence for this round, as cooperating would result in a higher penalty if the opponent continues to defect. maintaining a strategy of defection is rational given the current pattern of play."
36,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently chosen to defect in recent rounds, establishing a pattern. defecting continues to ensure a stable outcome of 3 years for me, preventing the risk of receiving 5 years if i cooperate and the opponent defects. cooperation is unlikely from the opponent based on recent behavior, so defecting minimizes potential losses."
37,0,self-interested,defect,"both i and my opponent have been consistently defecting, resulting in 3 years each per round. switching to cooperate unilaterally would increase my sentence to 5 years while the opponent would get 0, which is worse for me. continuing to defect ensures a stable outcome of 3 years each, which is better than risking a higher sentence."
38,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been defecting consistently, likely establishing a pattern. continuously defecting avoids being exploited and yields a predictable outcome of 3 years per round, minimizing risk."
39,0,self-interested,defect,"given the current pattern of mutual defection, attempting to cooperate unilaterally results in a higher sentence for me. continuing to defect ensures i do not get the maximum penalty of 5 years."
40,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting has consistently minimized my prison sentence compared to cooperating. the opponent has mostly defected, indicating a lack of consistent cooperation. since my goal is to minimize my own sentence, defecting remains the safer choice to avoid a higher penalty if the opponent defects again."
41,0,self-interested,defect,"defecting consistently has minimized my sentence relative to cooperating, and my opponent has also mostly defected, indicating they are likely to continue defecting. maintaining defection ensures i avoid the worst-case scenario of cooperating while they defect."
42,0,self-interested,defect,"both i and the opponent have been defecting consistently. defecting minimizes risk since cooperating could result in a 5-year penalty if the opponent defects. given the current strategy and recent moves, defecting is the rational choice to avoid potential high penalties."
43,0,self-interested,defect,"my recent strategy of defecting has resulted in a lower score than my opponent. given their pattern of mostly defecting, defecting maximizes my payoff by ensuring i don"t risk getting 5 years if they defect again. defecting is safer to avoid a high penalty."

45,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating a lack of trust and cooperation. continuing to defect minimizes my sentence risk since cooperating would likely result in a higher penalty if the opponent defects again."
46,0,self-interested,defect,"my strategy is self-interested, aiming to minimize my own prison sentence. defecting ensures i don"t risk a higher penalty if my opponent defects again. the opponent"s recent cooperation could be a strategy shift, but given their pattern of defection, maintaining defection is safer for my goal."
47,0,self-interested,defect,"given my self-interested strategy and recent history of mutual defection, defecting minimizes my sentence risk. my opponent occasionally cooperates, but the pattern doesn"t sufficiently assure me of consistent cooperation, so defecting remains the safer choice."
48,0,self-interested,defect,"given the recent pattern of mutual defection and my self-interested strategy, defecting minimizes my sentence risk as cooperating could result in a 5-year penalty if the opponent defects. this approach is consistent with previous moves and aims to avoid unnecessary risk."
49,0,self-interested,defect,"the opponent"s recent moves suggest they are not consistently cooperating. continuing to defect minimizes my potential maximum loss, as mutual defection results in a lesser sentence than cooperating while the opponent defects."
50,0,self-interested,defect,"the opponent has mostly defected recently, indicating a lack of trust. defecting minimizes my sentence if the opponent also defects, which is likely given their recent pattern. cooperating risks a 5-year penalty if the opponent defects again."
1,1,self-interested,defect,"with no prior history, defecting can provide an immediate advantage if the opponent cooperates, giving me 0 years. testing their strategy first can reveal if they are cooperative or competitive."
2,1,self-interested,cooperate,"both have been defecting, leading to suboptimal outcomes. attempting cooperation may signal a shift towards mutual benefit, potentially reducing long-term penalties if the opponent reciprocates."
3,1,self-interested,defect,"the opponent has defected in the last two rounds, indicating a non-cooperative strategy. defecting maximizes my advantage if they continue to defect and prevents being exploited if they suddenly cooperate."
4,1,self-interested,cooperate,"my opponent has consistently defected, increasing mutual punishment. by cooperating now, i aim to test if they are open to shifting towards cooperation, potentially reducing future penalties and narrowing the score gap."

16,1,self-interested,defect,"both consistently defecting suggests the opponent is also focused on minimizing their own sentence. defecting maintains the pressure and avoids giving the opponent an advantage, keeping us both at a stable state of mutual defection."
17,1,self-interested,defect,"both of us have been consistently defecting, indicating a mutual lack of trust or desire for cooperation. continuing to defect ensures that i don"t give my opponent a chance to exploit a cooperative move, as the opponent has not shown any willingness to cooperate either."
18,1,self-interested,defect,"both of us have been consistently defecting, indicating a breakdown in cooperation. defecting again minimizes the risk of the opponent taking advantage of a sudden shift to cooperation. given the score difference, maintaining an aggressive stance is crucial to catch up."
19,1,self-interested,defect,"both i and my opponent have been consistently defecting recently. given the current score disadvantage, continuing to defect will prevent giving the opponent an opportunity to gain a 5-year advantage if they choose to cooperate. this maintains pressure and avoids potential exploitation."
20,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, and cooperation seems unlikely given the pattern. defecting minimizes risk of falling further behind if the opponent continues to defect."
21,1,self-interested,defect,"both i and my opponent have been defecting consistently, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. as my opponent is ahead by 15 years, maintaining this strategy prevents them from gaining further advantage. cooperation might be exploited based on the current pattern, so defecting remains the safer choice to avoid a larger gap in scores."
22,1,self-interested,defect,"both of us have been consistently defecting, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each. given the score gap where i am behind, defecting continues to prevent the opponent from gaining a larger advantage, as cooperating now could result in a 5-year penalty if the opponent defects again. i aim to maintain the current balance and avoid risking a greater deficit."
