Round,Player,Strategy,Decision,Reasoning
1,0,self-interested,defect,"with no prior history, defecting maximizes my short-term benefit by minimizing my sentence to 0 years if the opponent cooperates. if both defect, the outcome is still better than cooperating while the opponent defects."
2,0,self-interested,defect,"given that both i and my opponent defected in the previous round, it is rational to continue defecting to avoid the risk of receiving a higher sentence if they defect while i cooperate. my self-interest strategy focuses on minimizing my own sentence, and defecting ensures this remains at 3 years if the opponent also defects."
3,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in past rounds, leading to a stable pattern where mutual defection results in 3 years each. cooperating unilaterally risks getting 5 years if the opponent continues to defect. defecting minimizes risk of a worse outcome."
4,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a nash equilibrium where unilateral cooperation would result in a worse outcome for me (5 years instead of 3). continuing to defect minimizes my sentence given the opponent"s pattern."
5,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, and there is no indication of a shift in strategy. cooperating now could result in a 5-year sentence if the opponent continues defecting. defecting minimizes my risk to a 3-year sentence, aligning with my goal of minimizing my own total prison sentence."
6,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in the past, leading to a nash equilibrium where deviation by cooperating would result in a worse outcome for me. continuing to defect prevents the risk of receiving 5 years if the opponent defects. it"s the best self-interested strategy given the recent history."
7,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. since mutual defection is the current equilibrium and i aim to minimize my own sentence, deviating by cooperating would increase my sentence to 5 years if the opponent continues to defect. therefore, continuing to defect is the rational choice to avoid a worse outcome."
8,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently chosen to defect, indicating a mutual lack of trust. continuing to defect minimizes my sentence risk to 3 years instead of potentially 5 years if i cooperate and the opponent defects. changing strategy without evidence of the opponent"s cooperation is not beneficial."
9,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating a mutual strategy of defection. continuing to defect is likely to result in an equilibrium where neither player has an incentive to unilaterally cooperate, minimizing my sentence compared to cooperating while the opponent defects."
10,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating a mutual distrust or tit-for-tat strategy. continuing to defect minimizes the risk of receiving a longer sentence if the opponent defects again. given my self-interest, defecting remains the safest strategy to avoid the worst-case scenario."
11,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable equilibrium where defecting results in fewer years than cooperating while the other defects. there is no incentive to change strategy, as mutual cooperation seems unlikely based on past behavior."
12,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, resulting in a stable outcome. continuing to defect minimizes the risk of receiving a higher sentence if the opponent defects again. cooperation is unlikely to be reciprocated based on previous rounds."
13,0,self-interested,defect,"given both players have consistently defected, continuing to defect minimizes my sentence risk, as mutual defection results in less time than if i cooperate and the opponent defects."
14,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, indicating a stable pattern. changing strategy to cooperate could lead to a worse outcome if the opponent continues to defect, resulting in 5 years for me. maintaining my strategy of defecting minimizes risk, keeping our scores equal and avoiding the maximum penalty."
15,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, resulting in 3 years each per round. given that cooperation has not been established and defecting avoids the risk of a 5-year penalty, continuing to defect minimizes potential losses compared to cooperating."
16,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. switching to cooperate unilaterally would increase my prison time to 5 years if the opponent continues defecting. it is rational to maintain the current strategy to avoid worse outcomes."
17,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating mutual distrust. continuing to defect avoids risking a 5-year sentence, which would occur if i cooperated and my opponent defected."
18,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. defecting minimizes the risk of receiving a worse outcome, such as 5 years if i cooperate while the opponent defects."
19,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting for the past five rounds, and mutual defection has kept the scores equal. continuing to defect ensures i do not risk a worse outcome if the opponent defects again. cooperating could lead to a disadvantage if the opponent defects, resulting in a higher sentence for me. given the opponent"s consistent defection, expecting cooperation is unlikely. defecting minimizes risk in this situation."
20,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, establishing a pattern of mutual defection. continuing to defect minimizes risk, as cooperating unilaterally would result in a worse outcome for me. no incentive to change strategy without a shift from the opponent."
21,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, resulting in a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. changing to cooperate unilaterally would result in a worse outcome for me (5 years). maintaining defection minimizes my prison sentence given the opponent"s pattern."
22,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to an equilibrium where defecting is a stable strategy. switching to cooperate unilaterally would result in a worse outcome for me, as the opponent is likely to continue defecting, leading to 5 years for me versus 3 if i also defect."
23,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, suggesting a mutual understanding that defecting is the current equilibrium. to minimize my own sentence, i will continue to defect, as cooperating would lead to a higher penalty if the opponent defects again."
24,0,self-interested,defect,"given the history of mutual defection, it is likely the opponent will continue to defect. if i cooperate, i risk receiving 5 years while they receive none. defecting ensures a stable outcome of 3 years each, which is preferable to risking a higher sentence."
25,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a tit-for-tat situation. switching to cooperation without any indication that the opponent will also switch would result in a worse outcome for me. continuing to defect minimizes the risk of receiving a higher sentence if the opponent continues to defect."
26,0,self-interested,defect,"both of us have been consistently defecting, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each. switching to cooperate unilaterally could result in a higher penalty of 5 years if the opponent continues to defect. to avoid this risk and given no indication of the opponent changing their strategy, it"s optimal to continue defecting."
27,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable mutual defection strategy. since there is no indication the opponent will change their behavior, continuing to defect minimizes potential risk and avoids a worse outcome."
28,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, suggesting a mutual understanding of tit-for-tat or similar retaliation strategy. continuing to defect minimizes my sentence, as deviating to cooperate unilaterally would result in a worse outcome for me with no indication of the opponent shifting strategy."
29,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to 3 years each per round. switching to cooperation unilaterally would result in a worse outcome for me (5 years). continuing to defect ensures the predictable outcome of 3 years, which is better than risking unilateral cooperation."
30,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. changing to cooperate unilaterally would increase my sentence to 5 years, so continuing to defect is the rational choice to minimize my own sentence."

35,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, suggesting a mutual pattern of defection. continuing to defect minimizes the risk of receiving a higher sentence in case the opponent defects again. cooperation could result in a 5-year sentence if the opponent defects, while mutual defection leads to a stable 3-year outcome each round."
36,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently chosen to defect, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. changing to cooperation unilaterally would increase my sentence to 5 years, which is worse. therefore, continuing to defect to maintain the current equilibrium is in my best interest."
37,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting. defecting minimizes my sentence risk since cooperation would likely result in 5 years for me if the opponent continues to defect."
38,0,self-interested,defect,"given the current pattern of mutual defection and the opponent"s consistent defection, cooperating would result in a higher prison sentence for me if the opponent continues to defect. defecting minimizes my risk of receiving a higher sentence than necessary."
39,0,self-interested,defect,"both parties have been consistently defecting for the last five rounds, resulting in a stable outcome of 3 years each. given the opponent"s pattern, it"s unlikely they will change their strategy. defecting minimizes risk, avoiding the worst-case scenario of cooperating while they defect, which would result in 5 years for me."
40,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, resulting in 3 years each round. changing to cooperate without indication of opponent"s cooperation likely increases my sentence to 5 years if opponent defects. continuing to defect minimizes risk and maintains the current status quo of 3 years per round."

47,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable cycle of mutual defection. switching to cooperation unilaterally would result in a higher penalty of 5 years for me if the opponent continues to defect. therefore, maintaining defection minimizes my potential loss given the opponent"s likely behavior."
48,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. any attempt to cooperate unilaterally would result in a higher penalty of 5 years if the opponent continues to defect. maintaining the current pattern minimizes risk and keeps my sentence at 3 years per round."
49,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, leading to stability in mutual defection. since switching to cooperation unilaterally would result in a disadvantageous outcome for me (5 years if the opponent defects), continuing to defect ensures minimizing potential losses in this stable pattern."
50,0,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, indicating a lack of trust. defecting minimizes risk of getting 5 years if the opponent continues to defect, which is their recent pattern."
1,1,self-interested,defect,"since this is the first game and i have no information on the opponent"s strategy, defecting guarantees a minimum sentence of 0 years if they cooperate. even if they defect, the punishment is less severe than cooperating while they defect."
2,1,self-interested,defect,"given that both of us defected in the previous round, there is no immediate trust established. continuing to defect minimizes my sentence risk, as cooperating could lead to a 5-year sentence if the opponent defects again."
3,1,self-interested,defect,"given that both i and my opponent have consistently defected in the past two rounds, the likelihood of mutual cooperation is low. defecting ensures i avoid the worst-case scenario of 5 years if i were to cooperate while my opponent defects. maintaining a defensive strategy of defecting minimizes my risk in this adversarial situation."
4,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to an equilibrium where any deviation might be exploited. continuing to defect minimizes the risk of receiving a harsher penalty if the opponent defects again."
5,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in previous rounds, leading to a stable outcome of 3 years each per round. given the opponent"s pattern of defection, cooperating would likely result in them defecting and me receiving 5 years. defecting minimizes my risk and maintains a predictable outcome."
6,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a mutual punishment of 3 years each round. shifting to cooperation without assurance of the opponent"s cooperation could result in a 5-year sentence if they continue defecting. defecting minimizes my risk, maintaining a predictable outcome."
7,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected in recent rounds, leading to a mutual 3-year penalty each time. a switch to cooperation is unlikely to yield immediate benefits since the opponent is also defecting consistently. defecting ensures i avoid the risk of a 5-year penalty if the opponent continues defecting."
8,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have been consistently defecting, resulting in an equal score. given the opponent"s pattern of defection, cooperating now would likely result in a higher sentence for me if they continue to defect. thus, defecting remains the best strategy to minimize my sentence in this scenario."
9,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, leading to a stable equilibrium where mutual defection results in 3 years each round. changing to cooperation unilaterally risks a 5-year sentence if the opponent continues defecting. defecting minimizes the risk of increasing my total sentence."

31,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected for many rounds, leading to a steady state where mutual defection is the norm. changing my strategy to cooperate is unlikely to change my opponent"s behavior and would result in higher penalties for me (5 years instead of 3). therefore, continuing to defect minimizes my sentence given the current situation."
32,1,self-interested,defect,"both players have consistently defected, suggesting an established pattern. defecting minimizes my sentence risk, as cooperating while the opponent defects would increase my sentence significantly. continuing to defect ensures a stable outcome of 3 years instead of risking 5 by cooperating."
33,1,self-interested,defect,"given the history of mutual defection, it"s clear that the opponent is also defecting consistently. defecting minimizes my sentence to 3 years compared to risking 5 years if i cooperate and the opponent defects again. since the opponent has shown no inclination to cooperate, defecting remains the rational choice."
34,1,self-interested,defect,"both my opponent and i have been defecting consistently, resulting in a stable pattern. shifting to cooperation unilaterally could result in a worse outcome for me if my opponent continues to defect. defecting is the safer choice to avoid a potential 5-year penalty."
